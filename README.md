## Installation
After cloning the repo, make sure you have node installed on your machine.
Then you can run the 'npm i' command to install the packages for the needed dependencies.
You will also need to 'cd' into the 'db' file so that you can create the database tables using the 'source schema.sql' command.
Exit mysql, and then run 'npm start' to start the server so that you can start creating requests to the http server at localhost:3001 in Insomnia.
